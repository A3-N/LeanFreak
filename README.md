# Tidbits
1. Changed compression to `lz4` for SUPA-FAST boot for the ISO. Tradeoff, ISO size might be slightly larger.

# TRCH - baseline

## ISO Creation
- airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d\archiso.conf - Compression Changed for faster boot on ISO
- profiledef.sh - Compression Changed for faster boot on ISO 
- airootfs/etc/modprobe.d/broadcom-wl.conf - Added broadcom-wl package for specific Broadcom chipsets that either donâ€™t work at all with open-source drivers Or work like dog (unstable, flaky connections)

## BIOS & UEFI
- syslinux/ - added more to this like memtest86+, hdt, Existing/Reboot/Poweroff.
- syslinux/ - supports BIOS El Torito and BIOS Legacy (MBR).
- Removed Support for UEFI 32-bit.
- efiboot/ && grub/ - Added UEFI support with grub. (In the future I would like to remove syslinux for full grub, but GRUB BIOS boot modes are a pain.)
